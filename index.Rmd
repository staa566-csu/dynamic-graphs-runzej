```{r}
library(ggplot2)
library(plotly)
View(economics)
eco <- plot_ly(economics,x= ~date,y=~unemploy,type = 'scatter',mode='markers')
eco
eco2 <- plot_ly(economics,x=~date)%>%
  add_lines(y=~uempmed,name="median")%>%
  add_lines(y=~unemploy,name="num in thousands")
eco2
eco3 <- eco2%>%
  layout(title="Umployment",
         xaxis=list(title=NA),
         yaxis=list(title="Number of Employment"))
eco3
           


```

(a)data source:
The economics data set is inside R and it describes the relationship between the rate of unemployment and the time series. The main variables I use here is "unemploy"(refers to the number of unemployed in thousands)

(b)Research question:
I want to discover "Is there a increasing of the number of unemployed from 1967 to 2015 ?"

(c)Plot_ly is the function I mainly use here because the x-axis is timely series and y-axis is the response varibale.Also use the lay-out function to specify the names and titles.
